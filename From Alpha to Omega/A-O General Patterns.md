# Necessary Information
While it is helpful to have paradigms memorised, there is a lot of information to take in, and learning the patterns can help to speed up the process.
## Definite Article

## Nouns
### 2nd Declension: Masculine, Neuter, Feminine
- Endings generally match the definite article **EXCEPT:**
	- -ος in the *masculine nominative singular*
	- -ον in the *neuter nominative and accusative singular*
	- -α in the *neuter nominative and accusative plural*

- **common feminine -ος nouns include:**
	- *ὁδος (road)*
	- *νοσος (sickness)*
### 1St Declension: Types

>[!warning] The ε, ι, ρ Rule
>**IF**: the *stem* ends in **ε**, **ι**, or **ρ** 
>**THEN**: use **ᾱ** instead of **η** in the *singular* 

##### 1st declension nouns:	
- **Long vowel  (ᾱ/η)**
	- For long vowel feminine nouns where the *ε, ι, ρ rule* DOESN'T apply, follow the definite article exactly
	- Where the rule applies, use **ᾱ** instead of **η** in the *singular*
- **Short vowel (α)**
	- For short vowel feminine nouns where the *ε, ι, ρ rule* DOESN'T apply (θᾰ́λᾰττᾰ), remember that the vowel **changes** from α to η in the *genitive* and *dative*
- **Masculine**
	- Has the 2nd declension *-ου* ending in the *genitive singular*

---
## Demonstratives/Adjectives
- ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε (this, the nearer) is just the definite article + δε
- οὗτος, αὕτη, τοῦτο (this, the further) only differs from the expected in the *nominative masculine and feminine*, where the initial τ is dropped
- ἐκεῖνος declines according to the *2-1-2 pattern* of endings

>[!note] The 2-1-2 Pattern
>the 2-1-2 pattern referrs to a group of adjectives which use 2nd declension endings for masculine and neuter, and 1st declension endings for feminine

## Verbs 
- The present and future tenses use the **primary endings**
- The imperfect uses the **secondary endings**

|                     | **active** | **middle/passive** |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| *Primary Endings*   | -ω         | -ομαι              |

|                     | -ετε       | -εσθε              |
|                     | -ουσι      | -ονται             |
|                     | **active** | **middle/passive** |
| *Secondary Endings* | -ον        | -ομην              |
|                     | -ες        | -ου                |
|                     | -ε         | -ετο               |
|                     | -ομεν      | -ομεθα             |
|                     | -ετε       | -εσθε              |
|                     | -ον        | -οντο              |

|      | **Present Active Imperative:** |
| :--: | :----------------------------: |
| S. 2 |               -ε               |
| S. 3 |              -ετω              |

| P. 3 |             -οντων             |

- The future is formed by adding -σ- between the stem and ending (sometimes causing a change of consonant)
	- σ + π, β, φ = **ψ**
	- σ + κ, γ, χ  = **χ**
	- Dental consonants (δ, θ, ζ) are **dropped**
- The imperfect is formed: augment + stem + ending
- the augment is an ε added to the beginning of a word
### μι-verbs: εἰμί
- μι-verbs are also called *athematic* verbs because they are formed without adding an ο/ω to the ending (this ω/ο is the *theme vowel* in the tenses covered so far)
