    <p class="left">Will I complete all of these things? probably not, I've met me and if you're bothering to read this you've also probably met me. I do however really want to do all of them, and to do at least some of them well. I can't keep a daily diary, I've tried that before and it doesn't work, so I want to try this and see if it will keep me noting things down, and act as a record for how on track I am. I'll also probably post a bunch of resources I make for the stuff I'm studying so if anyone's doing Classics (Greek, Latin, Akkadian) keep an eye out (i'm only really any good at philosophy but still). </p>
