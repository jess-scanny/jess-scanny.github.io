    <h3><em>A log of a hopefully productive year</em></h3>
    <h3>Welcome to my year of rest and rustication.</h3>
    <h5>(I haven't actually read the book referenced here, however I suppose I'll have the time to now)</h5>
    <p class="left">So why make this a website at all? Well I keep claiming I know how to make websites so I think its worth checking if thats at all true. By the end of this year (Next October, we're working with the academic years here) I want a full bank of everything productive that I did this year.</p>
    <p class="left">I know if I write nothing down, and I set down no goals, I'll hit next october and not be able to tell you one single thing I did for an entire year. this doesn't mean I'd otherwise spend the year rotting and wallowing, I just wouldn't use it for anything. </p>
    <p class="left">To that end I've decided that I want this website to be a record of the things I do over the things i do over the next year, whether productive or not. I have one rule: never be doing nothing. by this I don't mean spend every second of every day stressed, with a full schedule and things to do. relaxing counts as something; drawing, painting, reading, and writing are all 'somethings'. what does count as nothing is 'Tiktok', or watching Netflix shows I don't really care about. You may be thinking this seems like a very very low bar to set for an entire year. If you are thinking this you are underestimating the amount of effort it takes me to acknowledge the concept of time over long periods. I've lost months before and can again. </p>
    <p class="left">I do actually have a set of goals for the year, some self-imposed, some set by the university:</p>
    <p class="left"><b>Necessary Goals:</b></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Pass collectons next Michaelmas to a 2:1 standard</li>
    <li>Complete all missed essays</li>
    <li>Be in a position to pass mods in february 2025</li>
    <li>Get a referral for ADHD (<-- hardest task on the list)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="left"><b>Personal Goals</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pass A-level maths</li>
      <li>7:30>2k (necessary rowing mention)</li>
      <li>Learn to coach rowing (2nd rowing mention)</li>
      <li>Get better at python/javascript/css/html</li>
      <li>Read a book every week</li>
      <li>Start learning Akkadian</li>
      </ul>
    <p class="left">Will I complete all of these things? probably not, I've met me and if you're bothering to read this you've also probably met me. I do however really want to do all of them, and to do at least some of them well. I can't keep a daily diary, I've tried that before and it doesn't work, so I want to try this and see if it will keep me noting things down, and act as a record for how on track I am. I'll also probably post a bunch of resources I make for the stuff I'm studying so if anyone's doing Classics course IIB mods keep an eye out (i'm only really any good at philosophy but still). </p>
